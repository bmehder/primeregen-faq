    question: 'Comorbidities, Diabetes and Wound Care',
    answer: `<p>
        When a person is diagnosed with two or more diseases, this is called Comorbidities. There is
        usually a significant impact on the patient's health and opportunity for healing when
        comorbidities exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most common comorbidity that can affect wound healing is Diabetes. At Restore First
        Health we examine the blood glucose of our patients as an elevated glucose level places a
        patient at risk for infection and delayed healing. High blood glucose levels impair
        functions of whit blood cells. These white blood cells are critical to the role of the
        immune system. When there is a breakdown of this immune response, the body is less able to
        fight infection and close wounds properly. We obtain these glucose levels through routine
        blood work ordered by the physician. Our team also looks at the kidney, liver and overall
        health status of a patient as it relates to ability to have proper wound healing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you suffer from comorbidities and have a chronic wound, we can help. Our care team is
        trained and educated in specifically addressing Diabetic Care and its influence on Wound
        Care.

    question: 'Can Nutrition Impact My Wound Care?',
    answer: `<p>
        Did you know that a high protein diet can actually help a patient heal faster? Protein helps
        the body build muscle and skin. If patients have a low level of protein in their diet, this
        can inhibit, or prevent the proper healing. There are many foods that are high in protein to
        consider adding into your daily nutrition including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lean meats such as chicken, pork and fish</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Dairy Products (greek yogurt and cottage are higher in protein)</li>
        <li>Seeds and nuts</li>
        <li>Legumes like beans and lentils</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Another important component to support healing is hydration - getting lots of water and
        electrolytes into your body. Water takes nutrients to and from our cells that promote
        healing and it's extremely important to ensure that a patient does not become dehydrated
        which can lead to complications.
      </p>

      <p>Tips for remaining hydrated to promote healing include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drink water throughout the day, not just at meals</li>
        <li>
          Make sure to drink water or other fluids after turning or repositioning a patient who has
          mobility challenges.
        </li>
        <li>Be sure to take at least 4oz of fluid with medications</li>
        <li>Attach water bottles or travel mugs to wheelchairs for easy access.</li>
        <li>Ensure easy to reach water pitchers or access to refrigerator water station</li>
        <li>
          Reduce the amount of carbonated beverages, soda, juices and replace with water or drinks
          high in electrolytes
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Always check with your Restore First Health clinical team for more nutritional information
        and questions regarding how to enhance healing.

    question: 'How Can I Help my Loved One with their Severe Wound?',
    answer: `<p>
        People who suffer from chronic wounds often need assistance at home or mobilizing into the
        community. We are often asked by a patient's caregiver:
        <em>"How can I help them make improvements in their wound."</em>
      </p>

      <p>Our clinicians have some great suggestions:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Offloading immobile patients or moving their positions at least every two hours is
          critical to decrease pressure in a specific area of the body.
        </li>
        <li>
          Proper cleansing habits such as hand washing before touching near a wound to avoid any
          additional bacteria or potential infection is very important.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knowing signs of infection and monitor/report to the clinical team right away:
          <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem !important; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Redness</li>
            <li>Foul odor</li>
            <li>Increased drainage</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

    question: 'What are hyaluronic acid knee injections?',
    answer: `<p>
        Hyaluronic acid knee injections are a non-surgical approach to lubricating the knee joint
        and providing pain relief. For those who suffer from osteoarthritis, this approach is proven
        to be successful to reduce inflammation and can aid in the protection of joints.
      </p>`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Does it hurt to have the injection into your knee?',
    answer: `<p>
        We use a spray to numb your skin before the injection. Then we inject lidocaine which numbs
        inside the joint. We can see where we are moving the needle with an X-ray machine which
        helps us guarantee we are avoiding any bones and injecting the medication into the joint
        space. Patients often say they are surprised by how quick and minimal the pain/discomfort is
        with each knee injection.
      </p>`,
  },
  {
    question: 'How often will I need an injection appointment?',
    answer: `<p>
        Treatment of osteoarthritis knee pain is based on individual situations. Generally, patients
        receiving the hyaluronic acid knee injections are treated once or twice weekly for 4-6
        weeks. The procedure is shown to create significant relief for an average of 3-6 months,
        sometimes longer.

  {
    question: 'How long is my appointment?',
    answer: `<p>A typical knee injection appointment for an established patient is 30 minutes.</p>`,
